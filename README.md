# Who is this for?

This repository is made for people who want to see the implementation of the theory/problems in the book.
<br>
It isn't for those who want to see the in-depth theoretical explanation of the problems (there are other repos for that already)

# Prerequisites
- Python (at least version 3)
- g++

### Linux
They should already be installed for you on almost any modern Linux distribution.
<br>
If not, try these commands:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries" "Development Tools"`
- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -Syu base-devel`
- Other distros: check your distro's documentation and build from source if needed

### Windows
Follow the installation guide on this website: https://nuwen.net/mingw.html

### MacOS
You should already have both of them installed.
<br>
A Python 3 installer for MacOS can be found on the official website.
